 Abandon All Hope - Users guide
=======================

### Game objective
Survive as many days as you can from the beginning of zombie apocalypse.

### Managing survivors
* You can select survivors by clicking on them or by pressing the key linked to the survivor. You can find the key next to the survivor name in resources panel.
* Move them by clicking any other location on the game map while the survivor is selected.
* Deselect by clicking the survivor again, or pressing Esc key.
* You can change the survivor weapons from the dropdown lists below survivors name in resources panel. If you deselect a weapon, you can assign it to any other survivor.

### Building walls and traps
* Traps can be built by simply clicking the trap button and  then clicking the game map on a desired location.
* For walls, you first need to select the starting position of the wall and then select the length and direction of the wall by a second click.
* If you want to cancel building any constructions, simply click 'deselect all' button or press Esc key.

### Strategy tips
* Pause the game with pause key
* Bullets are shared between survivors, so if you run out, all survivors will switch to using melee weapons if assigned with one. Use your bullets wisely.
* Survivors will always use firearms instead of melee weapons if possible. Who would want to go near the walkers? Deassign pistols if you want them to use melee weapons.
* It might be a good idea to assign some survivors to kill zombies stucked at walls, with melee weapons to spare bullets.
* Beware going near walls once they turn red. They will break soon after.
* Traps will hold zombies until the end of a day. This means you won't be able to collect loot from them until at the end of the day. However, you can reuse the trap each day.
* Beware going too near to trapped zombies. If you fall into the same trap, you will most likely be bitten.
